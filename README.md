## Project Overview ðŸŽ‰

This project was inspired by this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cF3pIMJUZxM">video<a/>. I had different approach to this project than the authors of this video:

- I've used styled-components for styling so I could pass color props to the entire app (look at screenshots).
- I've created custom hooks for App and Chart component (readability),
- I've created new folder for API and added separate functions for fetching data,
- I've added logo (created by me in Figma) which uses color props mentioned above (Nothing epic but I wanted to check if I can pass props to SVG component and dynamicly change the color :D it worked and Im happy with result :D).
